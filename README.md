#### Overview
A project created in Grade 12 Computer science class. This is my first large
scale Java project. I have only added one level because of time
limits. Some parts of code are adopted from Java books
and Youtube tutorials. Game resources and sprites are downloaded
under free licence and I do not own any of them.
